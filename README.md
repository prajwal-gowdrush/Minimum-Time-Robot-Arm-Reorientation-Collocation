# Minimum-Time-Robot-Arm-Reorientation-Collocation-
Uses Indirect Shooting to solve linear tangent steering optimal control problem (also computes a numerical approximation using LGR collocation). Computes a numerical approximation to the solution of the Minimum-Time-Robot-Arm-Reorientation problem using Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) collocation method.
