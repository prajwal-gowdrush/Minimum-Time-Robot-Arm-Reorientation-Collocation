# Minimum-Time-Robot-Arm-Reorientation-Collocation-
In orthogonalCollocationAdigator folder RUN 'ExamplesSetup.m', and navigate to 'allExamples_ipopt' subfolder to find 'robotArm' and 'tgtsteer' subfolders and run 'robotArmMain.m' and 'tgtsteer.m' respectively. 
Uses Indirect Shooting to solve linear tangent steering optimal control problem (also computes a numerical approximation using LGR collocation). Computes a numerical approximation to the solution of the Minimum-Time-Robot-Arm-Reorientation problem using Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) collocation method.
