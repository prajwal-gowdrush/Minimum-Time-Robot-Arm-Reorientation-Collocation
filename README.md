# Minimum-Time-Robot-Arm-Reorientation-Collocation-
Used Indirect Shooting to solve linear tangent steering optimal control problem (also computed a numerical approximation using LGR collocation). Computed a numerical approximation to the solution of the Minimmum-Time-Robot-Arm-Reorientation problem using Legendre-Gauss-Radau (LGR) collocation method.
